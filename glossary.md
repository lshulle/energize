<li>Acid rain
<ul>
<li>Environment. The popular term for acid deposition; <em>i.e.,</em> rain or other precipitation that has an excessive concentration of sulfuric or nitric acids.</li>
<li>Acid rain is a popular term for the atmospheric deposition of acidified rain, snow, sleet, hail, acidifying gases and particles, as well as acidified fog and cloud water. The increased acidity of these depositions, primarily from the strong acids, sulfuric and nitric, is generated as a by- product from the combustion of fossil fuels. The heating of homes, using electricity, and driving vehicles, all rely primarily on fossil fuel energy. When fossil fuels are combusted, acid-forming nitrogen and sulfur oxides are released to the atmosphere. These com- pounds are transformed in the atmosphere, often traveling thousands of kilometers from their original source, and then fall out on land and water surfaces as acid rain. As a result, pollutants from power plants in New Jersey or Michigan can impact pristine forests or lakes in undeveloped parts of New Hampshire or Maine. Acid rain was discovered in 1963 in North America at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, in rain that was some 100 times more acidic than unpolluted rain. Innovations for reducing fossil fuel emissions, such as scrubbers in tall smoke stacks on power plants and factories, catalytic converters on automobiles, and use of low-sulfur coal, have been employed to reduce emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>. As a result of increasing global economies, fossil fuel combustion is increasing around the world, with concomitant spread of acid rain.</li>

<ul>
<li>Electricity. 1. A sudden and unexpected failure of electrical power, extending over a widespread area and resulting in the loss of lighting and other electrical services. 2. A purposeful reduction of electric lighting; <em>e.g.,</em> in a city during wartime as a precaution against a bombing attack</li>
<li>An interruption of electric service, often being larger in duration and geographic scope than other power outages. Interruptions of electric service occur for many reasons. Most frequent are local power outages on the distribution (low and medium voltage) network, resulting from equipment failures, or storm-related events causing tree limbs to interact with overhead wires. Less common are interruptions on the high voltage system, which transport bulk power over long distances from large central station generators to population centers. When one of these power lines, or large generators, unexpectedly fails, the power network automatically attempts to redistribute the flow of power between supply and demand. If the redirected flows overload the remaining power lines, then a cascading failure can occur. This happens when the breakers at numerous transformer stations “trip” to prevent the damage of equipment. Enough of these can result in a large regional blackout that can affect mil- lions of people for a period of hours to days. Notable North American blackouts include the August 2003 Northeast blackout that began in northern Ohio, and affected service from Michigan to New York City, including Ontario. Others include the Northeast Great Blackout of November 1965, which initiated the formation of the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), the New York City Blackout of July 1977, and numerous Blackouts in the 1990's on the West Coast when power flows from Pacific Northwest to California were interrupted.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Cap and trade
<ul>
<li>Policy. An emission trading program in which the government creates a fixed number of allowances and requires regulated sources to surrender them to cover actual emissions.</li>
<li>A policy to limit overall emissions from a group of sources in a cost-effective manner by using market forces. A fixed number of allowances, equal to the desired cap on total emissions, are distributed or sold to participating firms. Each firm must retire allowances corresponding to its emissions for that time period. Firms that find abatement more difficult can purchase excess allowances from others that reduce emissions more cheaply. Such trades benefit both firms while reducing overall compliance costs. When supply meets demand for allowances, in theory, the market price reflects the marginal cost of abatement among the firms, the cap is met, and total costs are minimized. The idea of using a system of tradable property rights to manage emissions was first articulated by economist Tom Crocker and political scientist J. H. Dales in 1966 and 1968, respectively. In practice, the 1990 U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments initiated a cap and trade program for sulfur dioxide emissions to combat acid rain. Since then, emissions trading has been used in California’s RECLAIM program and for nitrogen oxide emissions in the Northeastern states. Recently, the European Union began a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions. Several countries, most notably New Zealand, use a similar program of individual transferable quotas to manage allowable catch of fish stocks. Cap and trade is most effective when abatement costs are disparate, individual emissions are easily measured, and their environmental impacts are not significantly affected by the location of the source.</li>

<li>Carbon
<ul>
<li>Chemistry. A very common non-metallic element having the symbol C, the atomic number 6, an atomic weight of 12.01115, and a melting point about 360&#8451;; the active element of photosynthesis and the key structural component of all living matter.</li>
<li>Carbon is the sixth most abundant element in the universe and is unique due to its dominant role in the chemistry of life and in the human economy. It is nonmetallic element having the symbol C, the atomic number 6, an atomic weight of 12.01115, and a melting point about 360&#8451;. There are four known allotropes of carbon: amorphous, graphite, diamond, and fullerene. A new fifth allotrope of carbon was recently produced, a spongy solid called a magnetic carbon “nanofoam” that is extremely lightweight and attracted to magnets. Due to carbon's unusual chemical property of being able to bond with itself and a wide variety of other elements, it forms nearly 10 million known compounds. Carbon is present as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere and dissolved in all natural waters. It is a component of rocks as carbonates of calcium (limestone), magnesium, and iron. The fossil fuels (coal, crude oil, natural gas, oils sands, and shale oils) are chiefly hydrocarbons. The isotope carbon-12 is used as the basis for atomic weights. Carbon-14, an isotope with a half-life of 5730 years, is used to date such materials as wood and archeological specimens. Organic chemistry, a major subfield of chemistry, is the study of carbon and its compounds. Because carbon dioxide is a principal greenhouse gas, the global carbon cycle has become a focus of scientific inquiry, and the management of carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels is a central technological, economic, and political concern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carbon capture
<ul>
<li>Climate Change. 1. The removal of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from fossil fuels, either before or after combustion. See carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. 2. To carry out such a process; remove carbon dioxide from fossil fuels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)
<ul>
<li>Environment. A method to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), in response to climate change concerns, in which CO<sub>2</sub> is collected prior to release to the atmosphere and placed in long-term storage. Capture is most amenable to large stationary sources of CO<sub>2</sub>, such as power plants. Potential storage reservoirs include depleted oil and gas fields, deep saline formations, unmineable coal seams, and the deep ocean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide
<ul>
<li>Chemistry. CO<sub>2</sub>, a colorless, odorless, noncombustible gas that is uniformly distributed over the earth’s surface at a concentration of about 0.033 % or 330 ppm of air. In the atmosphere it results from the combustion of organic matter, including fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal. It is also produced by various microorganisms from fermentation and cellular respiration. CO<sub>2</sub> is used in carbonated beverages, as a pressurized gas, in fire extinguishers, and as a solvent. Plants uptake CO<sub>2</sub> in photosynthesis. CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas, and its concentration is rising as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels and land use changes; thus it has become the focus of public concern in recent years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carbon footprint
<ul>
<li>Climate Change. 1. The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). 2. Such an amount associated with a particular entity, such as a nation, community, or build.</li>
<li>“Ernest Hemingway left a significant footprint in a great many places—Spain, Italy, France, Cuba, Tanzania, and Canada, as well as his native United States.” (Vancouver Sun) This is a typical use of footprint in a figurative sense, to mean the impact made by a person’s presence or activity. The footprint metaphor was first used in an energy context by Canadian ecologist William Rees in the mid 1990's, when he and his graduate student Mathis Wackernagel collaborated to establish the concept of an ecological footprint, for which Wackernagel developed the methodology. The metaphor was then applied to a more restrictive term, carbon footprint, meaning the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas emissions produced by a given human activity, or associated with a certain entity such as a nation, an industrial process, or even an individual person or household. The development of the term carbon footprint was the reverse of ecological footprint, which originated in the scientific literature and then extended to general usage. Carbon footprint first gained currency in the popular media, in the early 2000's, and it took several years for the term to become well established in academic usage. A search of the vast ScienceDirect journal database shows that it was not until 2008 that “carbon footprint” began appearing regularly in the title of scientific papers, though now of course it can be found hundreds of times. Today, some experts propose the use of the term climate footprint, because it encompasses the full range of gases that can be involved with anthropogenic effects on climate, including ones that are not carbon-based.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carbon intensity
<ul>
<li>Measurement. 1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) produced or emitted per unit of energy produced or consumed. 2. The amount of carbon dioxide produced or emitted per unit of economic output; <em>e.g.,</em> kilograms of carbon released per dollar of gross domestic product. Thus, carbon-intensive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carbon-neutral
<ul>
<li>Climate Change. Describing an activity or process that does not generate a net increase in the level of carbon in a given system, especially the amount of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere. Thus, carbon neutralizing, carbon neutralization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Carbon sequestration
<ul>
<li>Environment. A suite of technologies that can sequester (store) carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in reservoirs other than the atmosphere. </li>
<li>One of the three major pathways for reducing atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in response to climate change concerns. The other two pathways are (1) lowering energy intensities through improved efficiency and conservation, and (2) switching to low or no carbon fuels, such as renewables or nuclear. Carbon sequestration refers to the suite of technologies that “sequesters” or stores the CO<sub>2</sub> in reservoirs other than the atmosphere, such as trees, soils, the oceans, and underground geologic formations. One form of carbon sequestration involves removing the CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, primarily through biological means. This is also referred to as enhancing natural sinks. Examples include reforestation, afforestation, no-till agriculture, and iron fertilization of the oceans. Another form of carbon sequestration involves capturing the CO<sub>2</sub> before it is emitted into the atmosphere and storing it in a secure reservoir. This is also referred to as carbon dioxide capture and storage. Capture is most amenable to large stationary sources of CO<sub>2</sub> like power plants. Potential storage reservoirs include depleted oil and gas fields, deep saline formations, unmineable coal seams, and the deep ocean. Carbon sequestration has the advantage of being compatible with today's energy infrastructure, which is highly dependent on fossil fuels. These technologies are viewed as a bridge to a more climate friendly future energy system.</li>

<li>Climate
<ul>
<li>Earth Science. 1. Average weather as defined by surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. 2. A statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of temperature, precipitation, wind, and other meteorological phenomena over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Climate change
<ul>
<li>A statistically significant difference noted either in the mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended period (decades or longer).</li>
<li>In order to define “climate change,” one must first define climate. The simplest definition of climate is, the average of the weather. A more rigorous definition, adopted by the World Meteorological Organization in 1966, is that climate is the mean state along with the variability and higher-order statistics of the state of the atmosphere, as computed over a 30-year sampling period. The climate of a given region is defined not only in terms of means or averages, but also in terms of the typical departures from average conditions from year to the next. The atmospheric variables of particular interest are temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and cloudiness. Fluctuations from one year to the next do not constitute a change in climate; rather, this variability is part of what characterizes or defines a given climate. A change of climate occurs only if the means and/or the variability change from one 30-year sampling period to the next. Thus, a change in variability with no change in means constitutes a change in climate, as does as a change in means with no change in variability. The use of 30-year sampling periods is arbitrary. If, for example, climate were defined based on a 100-year sampling period, then changes in the statistics from one 30-year period to the next would be classified as climatic variability (and part of the characterization of the climate) rather than as climatic change. Climate can change due to factors entirely internal to the climate systems (such as slow interactions between the atmosphere and oceans), as well as due to factors external to the climate system (such as changes in solar irradiance, systematic changes in the earth's orbit, or human-induced increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases).</li>

</li>
<li>Coal
<ul>
<li>1. A brown to black combustible, carbonaceous sedimentary rock formed by the compaction of partially decomposed plant material. 2. This substance when burned as fuel. Coal was the main type of fuel in industrial countries before the advent of the petroleum industry, and it is still an important energy resource.</li>
<li>A carbon-based rock that burns. Its origins are in prehistoric earth where generations of dead vegetation were deposited in an oxygen-depleted swampy environment to form peat. As geological forces compressed these deposits, the resulting high temperature and pressure converted peat to coal and occasionally, coal to diamond. Coal is denser than peat, contains less water, and has higher energy content. The elements found in coal are the same ones found in the vegetation, as well as the soils and waters associated with it. Those elements are most notably carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. Silicon, iron, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and virtually the entire Periodic Table of elements are generally present in smaller or trace quantities. Coal is ranked as lignite, bituminous, or anthracite, depending upon energy content; with increasing coalification, moisture content decreases and carbon content increases. Coal provided warmth that enabled the human population to move into northern latitudes as earth emerged from the most recent ice age. Today, in North America, coal is the predominant source of energy used to generate electricity. With advances in clean coal technology, coal is expected to serve as a dominant source of energy well into the future and even beyond the 21st century.</li>
