<li>Acid rain
<ol>
<li>Environment. the popular term for acid deposition; <em>i.e.,</em> rain or other precipitation that has an excessive concentration of sulfuric or nitric acids
Acid rain is a popular term for the atmospheric deposition of acidified rain, snow, sleet, hail, acidifying gases and particles, as well as acidified fog and cloud water. The increased acidity of these depositions, primarily from the strong acids, sulfuric and nitric, is generated as a by- product from the combustion of fossil fuels. The heating of homes, using electricity, and driving vehicles, all rely primarily on fossil fuel energy. When fossil fuels are combusted, acid-forming nitrogen and sulfur oxides are released to the atmosphere. These com- pounds are transformed in the atmosphere, often traveling thousands of kilometers from their original source, and then fall out on land and water surfaces as acid rain. As a result, pollutants from power plants in New Jersey or Michigan can impact pristine forests or lakes in undeveloped parts of New Hampshire or Maine. Acid rain was discovered in 1963 in North America at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, in rain that was some 100 times more acidic than unpolluted rain. Innovations for reducing fossil fuel emissions, such as scrubbers in tall smoke stacks on power plants and factories, catalytic converters on automobiles, and use of low-sulfur coal, have been employed to reduce emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>. As a result of increasing global economies, fossil fuel combustion is increasing around the world, with concomitant spread of acid rain.</li>

<li>Anthracite
<ol>
<li>Coal. a hard, slow-burning coal of the highest rank, used primarily for residential and commercial space heating; black in color with a bright, often submetallic luster, having a high percentage of fixed carbon (over 86 %) and a low percentage of volatile matter (under 14 %), a low moisture and ash content, and a hardness of 2 to 2.5 on the Mohs scale. Anthracite has the highest heating value of any type of coal, typically containing 22 to 28 Btu per ton.</li>

<li>Assets represent value of ownership that can be converted into cash.[1] Assets can be broken down into two major asset classes:Â  tangible assets and intangible assets. Tangible assets include current assets and fixed assets.[3] Current assets include inventory, while fixed assets include such items as buildings and equipment.[4] Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the marketplace. Examples of intangible assets include goodwill, copyrights, trademarks, patents and computer programs,[4] and financial assets, including such items as accounts receivable, bonds and stocks.</li>
