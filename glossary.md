<li><a id="AcidRain">Acid rain</a>
<ul>
<li>Environment. The popular term for acid deposition; <em>i.e.,</em> rain or other precipitation that has an excessive concentration of sulfuric or nitric acids.</li>
<li>Acid rain is a popular term for the atmospheric deposition of acidified rain, snow, sleet, hail, acidifying gases and particles, as well as acidified fog and cloud water. The increased acidity of these depositions, primarily from the strong acids, sulfuric and nitric, is generated as a by- product from the combustion of fossil fuels. The heating of homes, using electricity, and driving vehicles, all rely primarily on fossil fuel energy. When fossil fuels are combusted, acid-forming nitrogen and sulfur oxides are released to the atmosphere. These com- pounds are transformed in the atmosphere, often traveling thousands of kilometers from their original source, and then fall out on land and water surfaces as acid rain. As a result, pollutants from power plants in New Jersey or Michigan can impact pristine forests or lakes in undeveloped parts of New Hampshire or Maine. Acid rain was discovered in 1963 in North America at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, in rain that was some 100 times more acidic than unpolluted rain. Innovations for reducing fossil fuel emissions, such as scrubbers in tall smoke stacks on power plants and factories, catalytic converters on automobiles, and use of low-sulfur coal, have been employed to reduce emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>. As a result of increasing global economies, fossil fuel combustion is increasing around the world, with concomitant spread of acid rain.</li>

<li>Electricity. 1. A sudden and unexpected failure of electrical power, extending over a widespread area and resulting in the loss of lighting and other electrical services. 2. A purposeful reduction of electric lighting; <em>e.g.,</em> in a city during wartime as a precaution against a bombing attack</li>
<li>An interruption of electric service, often being larger in duration and geographic scope than other power outages. Interruptions of electric service occur for many reasons. Most frequent are local power outages on the distribution (low and medium voltage) network, resulting from equipment failures, or storm-related events causing tree limbs to interact with overhead wires. Less common are interruptions on the high voltage system, which transport bulk power over long distances from large central station generators to population centers. When one of these power lines, or large generators, unexpectedly fails, the power network automatically attempts to redistribute the flow of power between supply and demand. If the redirected flows overload the remaining power lines, then a cascading failure can occur. This happens when the breakers at numerous transformer stations “trip” to prevent the damage of equipment. Enough of these can result in a large regional blackout that can affect mil- lions of people for a period of hours to days. Notable North American blackouts include the August 2003 Northeast blackout that began in northern Ohio, and affected service from Michigan to New York City, including Ontario. Others include the Northeast Great Blackout of November 1965, which initiated the formation of the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), the New York City Blackout of July 1977, and numerous Blackouts in the 1990's on the West Coast when power flows from Pacific Northwest to California were interrupted.</li>

<li><a id="Cap&Trade">Cap and trade</a>
<ul>
<li>Policy. An emission trading program in which the government creates a fixed number of allowances and requires regulated sources to surrender them to cover actual emissions.</li>
<li>A policy to limit overall emissions from a group of sources in a cost-effective manner by using market forces. A fixed number of allowances, equal to the desired cap on total emissions, are distributed or sold to participating firms. Each firm must retire allowances corresponding to its emissions for that time period. Firms that find abatement more difficult can purchase excess allowances from others that reduce emissions more cheaply. Such trades benefit both firms while reducing overall compliance costs. When supply meets demand for allowances, in theory, the market price reflects the marginal cost of abatement among the firms, the cap is met, and total costs are minimized. The idea of using a system of tradable property rights to manage emissions was first articulated by economist Tom Crocker and political scientist J. H. Dales in 1966 and 1968, respectively. In practice, the 1990 U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments initiated a cap and trade program for sulfur dioxide emissions to combat acid rain. Since then, emissions trading has been used in California’s RECLAIM program and for nitrogen oxide emissions in the Northeastern states. Recently, the European Union began a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions. Several countries, most notably New Zealand, use a similar program of individual transferable quotas to manage allowable catch of fish stocks. Cap and trade is most effective when abatement costs are disparate, individual emissions are easily measured, and their environmental impacts are not significantly affected by the location of the source.</li>

<li><a id="Carbon">Carbon</a>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry. A very common non-metallic element having the symbol C, the atomic number 6, an atomic weight of 12.01115, and a melting point about 360&#8451;; the active element of photosynthesis and the key structural component of all living matter.</li>
<li>Carbon is the sixth most abundant element in the universe and is unique due to its dominant role in the chemistry of life and in the human economy. It is nonmetallic element having the symbol C, the atomic number 6, an atomic weight of 12.01115, and a melting point about 360&#8451;. There are four known allotropes of carbon: amorphous, graphite, diamond, and fullerene. A new fifth allotrope of carbon was recently produced, a spongy solid called a magnetic carbon “nanofoam” that is extremely lightweight and attracted to magnets. Due to carbon's unusual chemical property of being able to bond with itself and a wide variety of other elements, it forms nearly 10 million known compounds. Carbon is present as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere and dissolved in all natural waters. It is a component of rocks as carbonates of calcium (limestone), magnesium, and iron. The fossil fuels (coal, crude oil, natural gas, oils sands, and shale oils) are chiefly hydrocarbons. The isotope carbon-12 is used as the basis for atomic weights. Carbon-14, an isotope with a half-life of 5730 years, is used to date such materials as wood and archeological specimens. Organic chemistry, a major subfield of chemistry, is the study of carbon and its compounds. Because carbon dioxide is a principal greenhouse gas, the global carbon cycle has become a focus of scientific inquiry, and the management of carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels is a central technological, economic, and political concern.</li>

</li>
<li><a id="CarbonCapture">Carbon capture</a>
<ul>
<li>Climate Change. 1. The removal of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from fossil fuels, either before or after combustion. See <a href="#CCS">carbon capture and sequestration</a>. 2. To carry out such a process; remove carbon dioxide from fossil fuels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a id="CCS">Carbon capture and sequestration</a> (CCS)
<ul>
<li>Environment. A method to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), in response to climate change concerns, in which CO<sub>2</sub> is collected prior to release to the atmosphere and placed in long-term storage. Capture is most amenable to large stationary sources of CO<sub>2</sub>, such as power plants. Potential storage reservoirs include depleted oil and gas fields, deep saline formations, unmineable coal seams, and the deep ocean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a id="CardonDioxide">Carbon dioxide</a>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry. CO<sub>2</sub>, a colorless, odorless, noncombustible gas that is uniformly distributed over the earth’s surface at a concentration of about 0.033 % or 330 ppm of air. In the atmosphere it results from the combustion of organic matter, including fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal. It is also produced by various microorganisms from fermentation and cellular respiration. CO<sub>2</sub> is used in carbonated beverages, as a pressurized gas, in fire extinguishers, and as a solvent. Plants uptake CO<sub>2</sub> in photosynthesis. CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas, and its concentration is rising as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels and land use changes; thus it has become the focus of public concern in recent years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a id="CarbonFootprint">Carbon footprint</a>
<ul>
<li>Climate Change. 1. The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). 2. Such an amount associated with a particular entity, such as a nation, community, or build.</li>
<li>“Ernest Hemingway left a significant footprint in a great many places—Spain, Italy, France, Cuba, Tanzania, and Canada, as well as his native United States.” (Vancouver Sun) This is a typical use of footprint in a figurative sense, to mean the impact made by a person’s presence or activity. The footprint metaphor was first used in an energy context by Canadian ecologist William Rees in the mid 1990's, when he and his graduate student Mathis Wackernagel collaborated to establish the concept of an ecological footprint, for which Wackernagel developed the methodology. The metaphor was then applied to a more restrictive term, carbon footprint, meaning the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas emissions produced by a given human activity, or associated with a certain entity such as a nation, an industrial process, or even an individual person or household. The development of the term carbon footprint was the reverse of ecological footprint, which originated in the scientific literature and then extended to general usage. Carbon footprint first gained currency in the popular media, in the early 2000's, and it took several years for the term to become well established in academic usage. A search of the vast ScienceDirect journal database shows that it was not until 2008 that “carbon footprint” began appearing regularly in the title of scientific papers, though now of course it can be found hundreds of times. Today, some experts propose the use of the term climate footprint, because it encompasses the full range of gases that can be involved with anthropogenic effects on climate, including ones that are not carbon-based.</li>

<li><a id="CarbonIntensity">Carbon intensity</a>
<ul>
<li>Measurement. 1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) produced or emitted per unit of energy produced or consumed. 2.

</li>
<li><a id="CarbonSequestration">Carbon sequestration</a>
<ul>
<li>Environment. A suite of technologies that can sequester (store) carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in reservoirs other than the atmosphere. </li>
<li>One of the three major pathways for reducing atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in response to climate change concerns. The other two pathways are (1) lowering energy intensities through improved efficiency and conservation, and (2) switching to low or no carbon fuels, such as renewables or nuclear. Carbon sequestration refers to the suite of technologies that “sequesters” or stores the CO<sub>2</sub> in reservoirs other than the atmosphere, such as trees, soils, the oceans, and underground geologic formations. One form of carbon sequestration involves removing the CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, primarily through biological means. This is also referred to as enhancing natural sinks. Examples include reforestation, afforestation, no-till agriculture, and iron fertilization of the oceans. Another form of carbon sequestration involves capturing the CO<sub>2</sub> before it is emitted into the atmosphere and storing it in a secure reservoir. This is also referred to as carbon dioxide capture and storage. Capture is most amenable to large stationary sources of CO<sub>2</sub> like power plants. Potential storage reservoirs include depleted oil and gas fields, deep saline formations, unmineable coal seams, and the deep ocean. Carbon sequestration has the advantage of being compatible with today's energy infrastructure, which is highly dependent on fossil fuels. These technologies are viewed as a bridge to a more climate friendly future energy system.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><a id="ClimateChange">Climate change</a>
<ul>
<li>A statistically significant difference noted either in the mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended period (decades or longer).</li>
<li>In order to define “climate change,” one must first define climate. The simplest definition of climate is, the average of the weather. A more rigorous definition, adopted by the World Meteorological Organization in 1966, is that climate is the mean state along with the variability and higher-order statistics of the state of the atmosphere, as computed over a 30-year sampling period. The climate of a given region is defined not only in terms of means or averages, but also in terms of the typical departures from average conditions from year to the next. The atmospheric variables of particular interest are temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and cloudiness. Fluctuations from one year to the next do not constitute a change in climate; rather, this variability is part of what characterizes or defines a given climate. A change of climate occurs only if the means and/or the variability change from one 30-year sampling period to the next. Thus, a change in variability with no change in means constitutes a change in climate, as does as a change in means with no change in variability. The use of 30-year sampling periods is arbitrary. If, for example, climate were defined based on a 100-year sampling period, then changes in the statistics from one 30-year period to the next would be classified as climatic variability (and part of the characterization of the climate) rather than as climatic change. Climate can change due to factors entirely internal to the climate systems (such as slow interactions between the atmosphere and oceans), as well as due to factors external to the climate system (such as changes in solar irradiance, systematic changes in the earth's orbit, or human-induced increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases).</li>

<li><a id="Coal">Coal</a>
<ul>
<li>1. A brown to black combustible, carbonaceous sedimentary rock formed by the compaction of partially decomposed plant material. 2. This substance when burned as fuel. Coal was the main type of fuel in industrial countries before the advent of the petroleum industry, and it is still an important energy resource.</li>
<li>A carbon-based rock that burns. Its origins are in prehistoric earth where generations of dead vegetation were deposited in an oxygen-depleted swampy environment to form peat. As geological forces compressed these deposits, the resulting high temperature and pressure converted peat to coal and occasionally, coal to diamond. Coal is denser than peat, contains less water, and has higher energy content. The elements found in coal are the same ones found in the vegetation, as well as the soils and waters associated with it. Those elements are most notably carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. Silicon, iron, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and virtually the entire Periodic Table of elements are generally present in smaller or trace quantities. Coal is ranked as lignite, bituminous, or anthracite, depending upon energy content; with increasing coalification, moisture content decreases and carbon content increases. Coal provided warmth that enabled the human population to move into northern latitudes as earth emerged from the most recent ice age. Today, in North America, coal is the predominant source of energy used to generate electricity. With advances in clean coal technology, coal is expected to serve as a dominant source of energy well into the future and even beyond the 21st century.</li>

<li><a id="Energy">Energy</a>
<ul>
<li>Physics. 1. A fundamental physical concept, defined classically as the capacity to do work. Can be described more generally as the potential ability of a system to influence changes in other systems by imparting either work (forced directional displacement) or heat (chaotic displacement/motion of system microstructure). 2. The use of this capacity to perform useful functions for humans, such as heating or cooling buildings and enclosures, powering vehicles and machinery, lighting, cooking foods, and so on.</li>
<li>In the mechanical sense,energy is the ability to do work where work is the action of a force acting on an object undergoing a displacement. Matter in motion is said to have kinetic energy because of its ability to change the motion of another object. Matter in a favorable position, such as water atop a dam, is said to have potential energy because of its ability to change the motion of another object once the water flows over the dam. Other important forms of energy include thermal energy, nuclear energy, electromagnetic energy, and gravitational energy. Energy can be transformed from one form to another. For example, a steam turbine converts thermal energy to mechanical energy, a nuclear reactor transforms nuclear energy to thermal energy, and a solar cell converts electromagnetic energy into electric energy. The physics principle of conservation of energy requires that there be no loss of energy in any energy transformation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Energy conservation
<ul>
<li>Consumption & Efficiency. 1. A collective term for activities that reduce end-use demand for energy by reducing the service demanded, <em>e.g.,</em> a reduction in the demand for gasoline by reducing the number of miles driven, or a reduction in the demand for natural gas for space heating by lowering the thermostat. 2. Another term for energy efficiency.</li>
<li>Energy conservation has been diversely interpreted as meaning (1) increasing the efficiency or productivity of energy use to maintain or increase economic output with less energy; (2) accommodating behavior by curtailing (rationing or “doing without”) energy; and (3) switching to more abundant energy sources. Energy efficiency, in the most common meaning of energy conservation today, involves technological change—the substitution of ingenuity for energy resources—to provide a given amenity level for less. Energy efficiency is sometimes quantified in terms of energy intensity, or the amount of energy required to produce a unit of goods or service. Energy conservation and energy efficiency can be stimulated by information (for example, labeling of appliances), technological progress (research and development), shortages (wartime rationing), price increases (price elasticity of demand), and codes and standards (for example, automotive fuel economy standards). Interest in energy conservation is driven not for its own sake but by economic, security, and environmental concerns, including climate change. Energy conservation, in an economic and policy context, thus means the intelligent use of energy through the reduction of waste.</li>

<li>Global warming
<ul>
<li>Climate Change. 1. Any general increase in the earth’s surface temperatures over an extended period of time. 2. The proposition that in the current era, global temperatures have been slowly rising. This is attributed to the phenomenon of atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide absorbing long-wave radiation as it is reradiated off the earth’s surface rather than this heat escaping into space, thus making the atmosphere warmer.</li>
<li>The theory that global climatic change, surface warming in particular, is increasingly caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning. Aerosol particles also emitted from fossil fuel and biomass burning are believed to result in cooling, partly masking global warming. However, the dominant effect is warming the entire troposphere (the atmosphere below about 11 kilometers containing most of the air’s mass) by 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius (eventually) if the preindustrial atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 270 ppm were to double. Without natural greenhouse gases (water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone), the earth would be a frozen iceball. As CO<sub>2</sub> has climbed above 360 ppm from fossil fuel burning, planetary mean temperatures rose to the highest in millennia; with warming amplified in the Arctic, thawing permafrost, thinning sea ice and creating marked recession of glaciers. Also observed, as predicted, is subsurface warming from heat penetrating the sea. Likewise, satellite-derived troposphere temperatures are rising, and the stratospheric cooling, the latter consistent with a CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse effect. Potential warming of the earth’s surface if the bulk of fossil fuel resources are burned could be as much as 10&#8451;, comparable to mid-Cretaceous climates when the poles were deglaciated and dinosaurs roamed Antarctica. Adverse impacts of such dramatic climate shifts on the biosphere and human economy are incalculable. The challenge for energy technology is slowing, stabilizing, and if possible reversing, fossil fuel burning induced global warming, requiring a revolutionary change in the global energy system.</li>

<ul>
<li>Earth Science. The trapping of heat by greenhouse gases (see next) that allow incoming solar radiation to pass through the earth’s atmosphere but prevent the escape to outer space of a portion of the outgoing infrared radiation from the surface and lower atmosphere. This process has kept the earth’s temperature approximately 33&#8451; warmer than it would be otherwise; it occurs naturally but may also be enhanced by certain human activities; <em>e.g.,</em> the burning of fossil fuels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Greenhouse gas (GHG)
<ul>
<li>Earth Science.any of the gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of infrared radiation emitted by the earth’s surface, the atmosphere, and clouds. This causes the greenhouse effect.</li>
<li>A gas that is largely transparent to the visible radiation reaching Earth from the sun but absorbs the thermal, infrared radiation that is radiated outward from the earth’s surface. The energy absorbed in the atmosphere is re-radiated in all directions, warming the earth’s surface. The greenhouse gases H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> occur naturally in the atmosphere and make earth's surface temperature approximately 33&#8451; warmer than it would otherwise be. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are now releasing additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, creating an enhanced greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases include H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, ozone, the chlorofluorocarbons, and SF<sub>6</sub>. Greenhouse gases exist in the atmosphere as molecules of three or more atoms. The atoms in the gas molecule vibrate with respect to each other, and the molecules rotate in space. Transitions between different energy levels of vibration and rotation in the molecule are quantized and occur with the absorption or release of infrared radiation. Fourier is generally credited with describing (in 1827) how the earth's surface temperature is controlled by the differential absorption of visible and infrared radiation, but use of the phrase “greenhouse effect” to characterize this phenomena seems to have appeared about 1950. Although the phrase has become entrenched in our vocabulary, it is a bit of a misnomer as the physical processes of the two phenomena are quite different. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere act to restrict the radiative transfer of energy whereas a glass greenhouse acts primarily by restricting the convective transfer of energy.</li>

</li>
<li>Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
<ul>
<li>Economics & Business. The total cost of generating electricity from a new power plant. Also known as levelized energy cost or levelized cost of energy.</li>
<li>This is a term most frequently used to characterize the total cost of generating electricity from a new power plant, though it can be applied to any other technology as well. It is similar to an annual home mortgage payment, except that it covers not only the cost of purchasing or building the plant (<em>i.e.,</em> the capital cost, or initial cost), but also the costs of maintaining and operating the plant over its useful life. Because capital and operating expenses occur in different amounts at different points in time, economists employ a “time value of money”—expressed as an interest rate, discount rate, or rate of return—to determine the “net present value” (NPV) of all lifetime costs. This is the total amount of money needed at the start of the project to acquire, operate and maintain the plant over its useful life, as well as pay all interest (or make a profit) on funds used to finance the project. The levelized cost is the uniform annual amount (dollars per year), paid over the life of the plant, which produces the same total NPV (dollars) as the actual project. The levelized cost can also be expressed as a cost per unit of electricity generated (<em>e.g.,</em> cents per kilowatt-hour) by dividing the total annual cost by the total annual kWh generated. Technologies with the lowest levelized cost are generally preferred in economic decision-making.</li>

<li>Life Cycle Assessment Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool for systematically evaluating the potential environmental impacts of products, services, and technologies. LCA examines inputs (resources) and outputs (emissions, wastes, and desired products) from “cradle to grave;” that is, across the entire product life cycle from resource extraction to materials processing to manufacturing and fabrication to use and then to collection, processing, and disposal. By doing so, LCA can help identify and avoid shifting of environmental burdens, <em>e.g.,</em> from one life cycle stage to another or from one environmental threat to another. What started as an approach to assess the environmental performance (“greenness”) of products has evolved into a standardized method to provide an analytical basis for the assessment and comparison of not only products, but also processes, materials, and service systems. The LCA framework is broadly defined in the ISO 14000 environmental management standards. LCA involves specifying the system to be investigated, and the compilation of a quantitative inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases. The identified inputs and releases are then evaluated with regard to their potential environmental impacts, including human health, ecosystems, and depletion of resources, and interpreted to help make more informed decisions. Recent efforts have focused on capturing indirect effects in supply chains and across the economy through the use of economic techniques and models, and broadening the traditional LCA framework to integrate environmental, social, and economic aspects at varying spatial levels. This is also referred to as life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA).</li>

<ul>
<li>Oil & Gas. A mixture of hydrocarbon compounds and small quantities of various nonhydrocarbons, widely used as a fuel throughout the industrialized world; it exists in the gaseous phase or in solution with crude oil in natural underground reservoirs.</li>
<li>Natural gas is a mixture of naturally occurring compounds that are in a gaseous state at the conditions of temperature and pressure at the earth’s surface. These compounds are mostly simple molecules formed of hydrogen and carbon (thus hydrocarbon). Methane, with molecules formed from four atoms of hydrogen and one of carbon, is the simplest form and generally is the most common compound in the mixture. Ethane, propane, butane, and pentane are slightly more complex compounds with two, three, four, and five carbon atoms respectively in each molecule. Other more complex hydrocarbon compounds can also be part of the mixture. Oil, by contrast, is an even more complex mixture of larger hydrocarbon molecules. Other non-hydrocarbon compounds are also present in natural gas but generally in lesser amounts. These non-hydrocarbon compounds include carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulfide. Some natural gas is present in fields that produce little or no volume of liquids (non-associated gas). Natural gas is also present in oil fields. In an oil field, natural gas can occur in separate pools or as a gas cap floating on the denser oil (associated gas). It can also be dissolved in the oil (dissolved gas). Some simple hydrocarbon molecules, such as methane, can be formed by inorganic processes; however, most of the natural gas that occurs in commercial gas or oil fields is likely of organic origin. Buried plant or algal material forms natural gas when subjected to sufficient burial and heating (thermogenic gas) or by the action of microbes (biogenic gas).</li>

<li>Renewable energy
<ul>
<li>Renewable/Alternative. Any energy resource that is naturally regenerated over a short time scale and either derived directly from solar energy (solar thermal, photochemical, and photoelectric), indirectly from the sun (wind, hydropower, and photosynthetic energy stored in biomass), or from other natural energy flows (geothermal, tidal, wave, and current energy).

</li>
<li>Renewable portfolio standard (RPS)
<ul>
<li>Policy. a market-based policy requiring that a minimum percentage of all electricity must be provided from renewable energy sources such as wind, wood and other biomass, or geothermal.</li>
<li>A regulation that requires a minimum market share for electricity generated from energy sources that have desirable environmental characteristics. While these are normally understood to be sunlight, wind, geothermal, waves, tides, hydropower, and organic matter, the definition varies somewhat between jurisdictions. Large hydropower is sometimes excluded while municipal solid waste, even if low in organic matter, is sometimes included. Some jurisdictions even include cogeneration of heat and power produced from natural gas combustion, as a way of valuing the much higher energy efficiency. The RPS may allow participants to trade among themselves in achieving the minimum market share requirement at the market-wide level, which in Europe sometimes involves the trading of green energy certificates. Because it specifies a physical requirement, the RPS is referred to as a quantity-based policy. This is in contrast to price-based policies such as environmental taxes or subsidies (in the form of above-market feed-in tariffs), both of which improve the relative economic advantage of renewables relative to fuels associated with emissions or extra risks of damage.</li>

<li>A solar cell is any material that converts sunlight directly into electricity. This property of materials is known as the photoelectric effect, first described in 1905 by Albert Einstein in his Nobel prize winning research. The first solar cell capable of generating substantial amounts of power and the sire to today's booming photovoltaic industry emerged from pioneering semiconductor research done at Bell Laboratories in the 1940s and early 1950s. Out of this research also came the transistor, probably the most important technical discovery of the last century, which has dramatically transformed virtually all aspects of human life. Experimenting with one of these new devices, Gerald Pearson, a Bell scientist, shined light on it and to his amazement recorded a significant amount of electricity produced by the silicon. In just a few short years, silicon solar cells enabled satellites to run almost indefinitely, revolutionizing commercial, military, and scientific space applications essential to modern life. On Earth silicon solar cells have brought abundant clean water, electricity, and telephone services to many in remote regions who had hitherto done without. Roof-top solar cell programs in the developed world promise to revolutionize the way we use electricity with each building becoming its own power plant interacting with the electric utility grid, or acting as a stand-alone system.</li>

<li>Uranium
<ul>
<li>Chemistry. A metallic element having the symbol U, the atomic number 92, an atomic weight of 238.029, a melting point of 1132&#8451;, and a boiling point of 3818&#8451;; a dense silvery solid with three naturally occurring radioactive isotopes.</li>
<li>Uranium is a very heavy metal that constitutes a concentrated energy source that is used in nuclear power. Uranium was apparently formed in super novae about 6.6 billion years ago. It occurs in most rocks in concentrations of 2 to 4 parts per million, and in much lower concentrations in seawater. Its radioactive decay provides the main source of heat inside the earth, causing convection and continental drift. Uranium was discovered in 1789 by Martin Klaproth, a German chemist, in the mineral called pitchblende. It was named after the planet Uranus, which had been discovered eight years earlier. Uranium is the heaviest of all the naturally occurring elements, being 18.7 times as dense as water. The high density of uranium means that it is used in the keels of yachts and as counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as well as for radiation shielding. ‘Natural’ uranium as found in the earth's crust is a mixture largely of two isotopes: uranium-238 (U-238), accounting for 99.3 % and uranium-235 (U-235) about 0.7 %. The isotope U-235 is important because under certain conditions it can readily be split, yielding a lot of energy. When the nucleus of a U-235 atom captures a neutron it splits in two (fissions), releases energy in the form of heat, and emits two or three neutrons. If enough of these expelled neutrons cause the nuclei of other U-235 atoms to split, releasing further neutrons, a fission ‘chain reaction’ can be achieved. This is the process that occurs in nuclear reactor where the heat is used to make steam to produce electricity. Each fission of a U-235 atom releases about 200 MeV (3.2 x 10<sup>-11</sup> joule)— about 50 million times as much energy as burning an atom of carbon. In other terms, a kilogram of natural uranium used in a typical reactor yields around 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, and a kilogram of enriched nuclear fuel yields 160,000 times as much. Fission produces hundreds of different kinds of fission products (isotopes of much lighter elements), most of which are radioactive. In addition, a uranium atom may capture a neutron without splitting, leading the formation of a number of radioactive transuranic elements. These byproducts comprise nuclear waste.</li>

<li>Wind farm or windfarm
<ul>
<li>Wind. An array or system of multiple wind turbines at a given site, used to capture wind energy for the production of bulk electricity for a grid. So called because of the sense of “harvesting” wind as if it were a farm crop.</li>
<li>A wind farm (often also called a wind park) is a cluster of wind turbines that acts and is connected to the power system as a single electricity producing power station. Generally it is expected that a wind farm consists of more than three wind turbines. Modern wind farms may have capacities in the order of hundreds of MW, and are installed offshore as well as on land. Modern wind farms generally are connected to the high voltage transmission system, in contrast to the early application of wind energy for electricity production with wind turbines individually connected to the low-voltage to medium-voltage distribution system. Hence, modern wind farms are considered power plants with responsibilities for control, stability, and power balance. Thus, wind farms are required to contribute to the control of voltage, frequency and reactive power needs in the power system and stay on-line during less critical grid faults, and to help maintain the stability of the power system. While wind farm production cannot exceed the power given by the instantaneous wind resource, capabilities for regulating the power output at time scales consistent with the power system needs, powering up and down, are also included in order to assist with balancing and stabilizing the power system. Most of the other technical issues with wind farms are associated with the close spacing of multiple turbines. The close spacing implies that extraction of energy by wind turbines upwind will reduce the wind speed and increase the turbulence, which may cause reduced efficiency and higher loads on downwind turbines. Another technical issue for large wind farms is the grid connection and the integration into the power system. Large wind farms are very visible, especially at land and in coastal areas and this together with a number of environmental concerns, such as possible disturbance of migrating birds, play an important role in the wind farm planning process and can result in selection of sites with less than optimal wind conditions. However, good wind conditions are essential for the economics viability of any wind project, and methods for accurately predicting wind climates at specific sites worldwide are constantly being improved.</li>
